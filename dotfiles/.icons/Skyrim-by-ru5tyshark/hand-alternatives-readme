Choose which cursor you would like to use then open the archive and drop the appropriate 'hand' file into the 'cursors' folder, remember lefties are included.
you replaced the original hand / link cursor and want to change it back, drop the 'hand' file from the 'hand-01.tar.bz2' file into the 'cursors' folder making sure to overwrite.
Then refresh the theme by changing it to something else then back again.
